				 <p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: center;"><font color="red" > Summary</font></p> 
				 <p> For Wild the contemplation of art is a sensual experience because it's perceived through the senses.
                    According to Wild, there is no moral or immoral book, they can't be judge for what they want to express, they can be judge only for they form.
                    The artist is the creator of beautiful things.
                   Art is beautiful and when we contemplate something beautiful we meet beauty. 
                    Art causes pleasure, it doesn't imply that the intellect to perceive it.
                    When we use intellect, we became ugly. (Art as the contemplation of beauty)

					<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: center;"><font color="red" >The Picture of Dorian Gray</font></p> 
					<p>Dorian Gray is a young aristocratic man, beautiful and innocent.
						One day he met a painter called BASIL HALLWARD, that decided to paint him for his endless beauty.<br> 
						Thanks to Basil, Dorian knew also LORD HENRY, that told him to enjoy his life now, because his youth and beauty would be passed.<br> 
						So Dorian, after has saw the paint that represented him, he started wanting to stay young and beautiful forever. <br>
						So the sign of age experience began to appear on the portrait of Dorian.
						The soul of the young man  became the picture, that records the signs of experience, corruption, horror and sins concealed under the mask of Dorian's timeless beauty.
						The picture is not an autonomous self: it is the symbol of Dorian's personality.<br> 
						Dorian started being selfish and a bad person that commits crimes.<br> 
						When the painters sees the corrupted image of the portrait, Dorian kills him. 
						Later Dorian wants to free himself of the portrait, witness to his spiritual corruption, and stabs it, but he mysteriously kills himself. 
						In the very moment of death the picture returns to its original purity, and Dorian's face becomes horrible. <br>
					   
						Dorian is a typical dandy, who thinks a man should live his life, without asking no one what to do.<br>
						He is only focused realising his wishes and his dreams.
						Dorian, after being influenced by Henry Lord, started thinking that youth is synonymous with beauty and happiness. <br> 
						The moral of this novel is that every crime and every bad behavior must be punished.
						For this reason, when Dorian destroyed the picture he died.
