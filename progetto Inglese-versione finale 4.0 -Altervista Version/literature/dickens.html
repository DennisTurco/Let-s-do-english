				<p>
				<br>
				 <p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: center;"><font color="red" > Summary</font></p> 
				 <p>Dickens was one of the most important critics of the Victorian Age. <br>
                    He was always on the side of the poor and of the working class.<br>
                    He criticized the social injustice between poor and rich, the ard condition of the children and the corruption.<br>
                    Dickens life is important to understand his thought about the Victorian Age, because he had a hard life and this inspired him to his literature.<br> 
                    London slums were described as areas of extreme poverty, crime and violence.<br>
The middle class men went to the slums to have fun, because here they could find: women, alcol and every time of the bad games.<br>
An example could be Jacob's Island, on the south bank of the thames, this had a reputation as one of the worst slums in London.<br>


                 </p> <br>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: center;"><font color="red" > Oliver Twist </font></p>
				<p>In the 19th century england taking care of poor people was the responsibility of the national church of England.<br>
                    The anglican church which was divided into parishes, local communities.<br>
                    If you were an orphan being looked after your local parish , you were referred to as a parish boy.<br>
                    
                    In OLIVER TWIST we have a PROGRESS, that is a particular kind of narrative that tells the story of a person's progress through the events of their life . 
                    This type of story tends to be episodic. 
                    Oliver Twist was named according to an alphabetic system to name children.<br>
                    In his novels the events are narrated by a third person narrator, but often they are seen through the eyes of the protagonist, a child, so the events are distorted and are full of gothic elements.
                    Most of Dickens' characters belong to the lower-middle class, the class which Dickens knew best and to which he was the first to assign the role of protagonist in fiction.
                    He focuses his attention on their economic worries, their fear of social instability and poverty with a sympathy, due to the same experiences he proved. Dickens' criticism of society is almost exclusively moral.
                    He attacks the law, parliamentary government, the educational system but he doesn't suggest any solution and improvements, but his attitude isn't destructive because he doesn't want to overthrow the socio-economic system.
                    Chapter 1: Dickens describes Oliver Twist's birth in an unknown workhouse. Yet from the beginning we can understand how life would be for Oliver Twist (ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble) and also the description of his difficult birth is an allegory of his future sorrow.
