				 <p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: center;"><font color="red" >Interior monologue and epiphany</font> </p> 
				 <p> The Interior monologue: <br>
					James Joyce coined the phrase <u>"stream of consciousness" </u>to define the continuous flow of thoughts that characterized the human mind. <br>  This definition was adopted by literary critics to define a kind of 20th-century literature which focused on this inner process.<br>
					At beginning of the 20th century writers gave more importance to subjective consciousness and understood it was impossible to reproduce the complexity of the human being using the traditional techniques and the utilized a new means of expression. <br>
					They adopted the interior monologue to represent in a novel the unspoken activity of the mind.  <br> Interior monologue is often confused with the stream of consciousness but they are different: in fact the "interior monologue" is the verbal expression of a physical phenomenon while in the stream of consciousness is the psychic phenomenon itself. <br> </p>
					Another characteristic of Joyce's writings is the peaks of intensity in the narration that the writer calls <u> "epiphanies" </u>. <br> An epiphany is a <i> sudden revelation </i> in which, according to the author, "the soul fo commonest object seems to a radiant". <br> It is a moment in which a spiritual awakening is experienced, when ordinary thoughts and feelings come together to produce a new awareness. 
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: center;"><font color="red"> Dubliners </font></p>
				<p> <i> "My intention was to write a chapter of the moral history of my country and I chose Dublin for the scene because the city seemed to me the centre of paralysis.<br> I have tried to present it to the indifferent public under four of its aspects: childhood, adolescence, maturity and public life. <br>The stories are arranged in this order. <br>I have written it for the most part in a style of scrupulous meanness and with the conviction that he is a very bold man who dares to alter in the presentment, still more to deform, whatever he had seen or heard."<br> <br></i>  
						Dubliners is a collection of fifteen stories, linked by a particular structure and the presence of the same themes. The main theme of the stories is the psychological paralysis of men. <br> Every story lacks of real actions, but ends with a revelation.<br> The stories are arranged in four groups, starting from childhood and arriving to mature and social life. <br>Each story is narrated from the perspective of a character and the language is various. The stories are arrenged in <i> four groups </i> that correspond to <i> four "phases" of life" </i>: <br> 
						1. <i> CHILDHOOD </i> (The sister) <br>
						2. <i> ADOLESCENSE </i> (Eveline)  <br>
						3. <i> MATURITY </i> (A Little Cloud) <br>
						4. <i> PUBLIC LIFE </i> (Grace  and The Dead) <br> <br>
						A recurrent theme in all the stories is the feeling of <i> paralysis </i> that many characters experience as a result of being tied to narrow cultural, social and political traditions. <br> This is also reflected in their relationships, which are conditioned by repressive religious and moral codes. <bR> In this hopeless city, people are shackled by the doctrines and life burdens and have lost ability and passion to pursue true love. <br>Instead, they have gradually fallen into the abyss of emotional paralysis.<br> </p>
				<p style="font-size: 22px; text-align: center;"> <font color="red">Eveline SUMMARY </font></p> 
				<p> Eveline Hill sits at a window in her home and looks out onto the street while fondly recalling her childhood, when she played with other children in a field now developed with new homes. <BR>Her thoughts turn to her sometimes abusive father with whom she lives, and to the prospect of freeing herself from her hard life juggling jobs as a shop worker and a nanny to support herself and her father.<BR> Eveline faces a difficult dilemma: remain at home like a dutiful daughter, or leave Dublin with her lover, Frank, who is a sailor.<BR> He wants her to marry him and live with him in Buenos Aires, and she has already agreed to leave with him in secret.<BR> As Eveline recalls, Frank's courtship of her was pleasant until her father began to voice his disapproval and bicker with Frank. <BR>After that, the two lovers met clandestinely.<BR>
					As Eveline reviews her decision to embark on a new life, she holds in her lap two letters, one to her father and one to her brother Harry. <BR> She begins to favor the sunnier memories of her old family life, when her mother was alive and her brother was living at home, and notes that she did promise her mother to dedicate herself to maintaining the home.<BR> She reasons that her life at home, cleaning and cooking, is hard but perhaps not the worst option-her father is not always mean, after all.<Br> The sound of a street organ then reminds her of her mother's death, and her thoughts change course. <BR>She remembers her mother's uneventful, sad life, and passionately embraces her decision to escape the same fate by leaving with Frank.<Br>
					At the docks in Dublin, Eveline waits in a crowd to board the ship with Frank. <br> She appears detached and worried, overwhelmed by the images around her, and prays to God for direction. <BR>Her previous declaration of intent seems to have never happened.<BR> When the boat whistle blows and Frank pulls on her hand to lead her with him, Eveline resists. <BR>She clutches the barrier as Frank is swept into the throng moving toward the ship. <BR>He continually shouts "Come!" but Eveline remains fixed to the land, motionless and emotionless. <BR></p>
